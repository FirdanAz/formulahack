**Formulahack** is a simple app developed with Flutter to display information about drivers, teams, circuits and seasons from 1950 to the current season. The app is developed in Flutter and Ergast API. In the Schedule screen, you can see the current season calendar and information about circuits and results for the finished races. In the Drivers and Teams screens, you can see current standings and information about them. In the History screen, you can select a season and see the schedule, driver and team standings for that season. For now we just build in dark theme and maybe soon will be avail in light theme.

### UI reference

You can access this link for the reference UI, and if you have some advice or you need to improve something we set this link **"can edit for everyone"** so u just add whatever you want. But disclaimer, do not delete the latest UI or change anything. Just duplicate and make your own UI version.
